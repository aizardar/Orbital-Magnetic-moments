# Orbital-Magnetic-moments
Bash scripts to extract the total magnetic moment along X and Z directions from the vasp output file OUTCAR

Note: 
1. In the current version, total mangetic moment is written on line number, NR =  38 in the generated file orbital_moment.dat. Depending on the number of atoms in the supercell, adjust the NR !
